This sample code is the implementation of a StreamCipher and Pseudorandom number generator (PRGen) using a pseudorandom function (PRF) class that was given to me. The two files that I created and edited were the StreamCipher.java and the PRGen.java files. The comments at the top of each of the files indicate the task which my code is intended to complete.
